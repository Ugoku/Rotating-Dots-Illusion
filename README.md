# Rotating-Dots-Illusion
Optical illusion where all dots are moving on a straight line, but together it looks like a larger circle rolling around.

This is a quick and dirty demo. It could be simplified by using Sass and/or HAML. This is an HTML/CSS version. A Canvas version will follow in the future.
